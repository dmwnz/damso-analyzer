# damso-analyzer
Power data analyzer inspired by DCR Analyzer

Just clone & open index.html in your favourite browser or use from https://dmwnz.github.io/damso-analyzer/

Runs locally in the browser with no server-side code.

Note if running locally (with file:///path/to/index.html): some browsers may require that the files are served from an HTTP/HTTPS server and will block javascript module loading. You can override this behavior by setting the privacy.file_unique_origin to false in the browser configuration.
